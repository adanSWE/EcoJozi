# EcoJozi Game Simulation  
**EcoJozi Game Simulation** is an interactive Java-based board game that simulates the development of the EcoJozi project as part of the *Making It Better Engineers Without Borders Challenge*. Built for the *CSC2058: Software Engineering and Systems Development* module at **Queen's University Belfast**, this game allows players to navigate the challenges of building a sustainable waste management solution in Johannesburg's Makers Valley.


## 🌍 **Project Overview**  
The Game lets players take on the roles of developers, community leaders, and planners. It is designed to mimic the real-world project management tasks of the EcoJozi initiative, including planning, development, design, and testing phases.


### **Key Objectives:**  
- Experience the complete project lifecycle through gamification.  
- Learn about sustainable waste management and community engagement.  
- Overcome real-world-inspired challenges, including budget constraints, design hurdles, and community issues.


## 🔧 **Technical Overview**  
The game is built using:  
- **Java** — Core game logic and event handling.  
- **Java Swing** — Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interactive gameplay.  
- **Git** — Version control and collaboration.
